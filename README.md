Artbot

A way to easily generate random SVG graphics that are either static or animated.  

## Project Status

This project is currently under construction.  It is in a working state as a proof of concept, but I would like to eventually add a backend to this project to allow users to save art they have generated.  Additionally, it would be good to allow users to undo art that was recently added, so that is another feature that is currently in the roadmap.
